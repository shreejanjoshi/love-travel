# love-travel
Add Places you want to visit - with React


Before I started to make this Love travel project. I also made this mini project to understant the work flow React.

1st in the App.js I wrote few html code. 

``` 
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Todos</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <div>
          <button>Delete</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
